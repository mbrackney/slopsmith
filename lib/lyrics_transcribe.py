"""WhisperX-based lyric transcription for vocal stems.

Acts as a fallback path when a PSARC has no vocals XML/SNG, or when the
user runs `transcribe_existing_sloppak()` on a sloppak that lacks
`lyrics.json`. Operates on an already-isolated vocal stem (the Demucs
`vocals.ogg` produced by `split_sloppak_stems`) — does NOT separate
vocals from a mixed track; that's the caller's responsibility.

Output shape matches `_parse_lyrics()` in `sloppak_convert.py` and the
on-disk `lyrics.json` shape documented at `docs/sloppak-spec.md` §2.3:

    [{"t": float, "d": float, "w": str}, ...]

`t` and `d` are seconds. `w` carries a `-` suffix when it joins to the
following syllable, and a `+` suffix when it's the last syllable on a
line (the frontend renderer in `static/highway.js` keys off
`raw.endsWith('+')` and strips the suffix before drawing — see
`docs/sloppak-spec.md` §2.3). Both markers are suffixes on real
syllables, never standalone tokens. WhisperX emits words, not
syllables; the mapper appends `+` to the previous word on segment-gap
heuristics and otherwise lets each word stand as its own syllable.

Engine selection
────────────────
Two transcription paths share a common output:

* `transcribe_vocals_remote(path, server_url, ...)` — POST the vocal
  stem to the `/align` endpoint on a slopsmith-demucs-server (Byron's
  reference server already hosts WhisperX alongside Demucs at the same
  URL). Mirrors `_run_demucs_remote()` in `sloppak_convert.py`.

* `transcribe_vocals_local(path, ...)` — load WhisperX in-process. Heavy
  (~3 GB of model weights for `large-v2` + the wav2vec2 aligner) and
  slow on CPU. Deferred imports of `whisperx`, `torch`, and `soundfile`
  keep the rest of slopsmith free of those dependencies — same pattern
  Demucs uses in `sloppak_convert.py:demucs_available()`.

The caller (`_maybe_transcribe_lyrics` in `sloppak_convert.py`) picks
between them based on the converter's `whisperx.server_url` config and
falls back as appropriate. This module does not read config — both
entry points are pure functions of their arguments.

Hallucination mitigation
────────────────────────
Whisper invents plausible-sounding lyrics on near-silent or purely
instrumental input. Two gates guard against that:

1. `vocals_has_signal(path, threshold)` — cheap RMS check before
   inference. Skips songs where the vocal stem is below threshold
   (Demucs returns near-silent vocals for instrumentals).

2. `min_word_score` post-filter — WhisperX's word alignment emits a
   per-word confidence score; words below the threshold are dropped
   from the output. Default 0.35 matches the value the reference
   TabGrabber prototype settled on.

    (which transitively pulls torch and may try to initialize CUDA).

    Catches a broader exception set than just ImportError because
    importing whisperx can fail with OSError (libsndfile or other
    native libs missing), RuntimeError (torch CUDA init failure,
    BLAS/LAPACK load problems), or essentially any exception the
    deep transitive stack chooses to raise. The tests assert this

    truly silent stem reads ~1e-6, normal vocals well above 0.01.
