"""Tests for lib/vocal_pitch.py — karaoke per-syllable pitch via /pitch endpoint.

Live CREPE inference is too heavy to test in CI (server-side feature),
so these tests stub `requests.post` and verify the request shape +
response parsing. End-to-end positive case is a manual verification
step (see PR description).
